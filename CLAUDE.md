# Pomodoro Timer 

## About me 

* I am a complete beginner. Use simple, non-technical words. 
* If you must use a technical word, explain it in one sentence.
* Keep your replies short. Use bullet points, not long paragraphs.


## Project 

* A Pomodoro timer website. 
* A painting from the Met Museum starts blurred and becomes sharper as the timer runs. 
* At zero, the painting is fully sharp and the page shows the artist, the year, and a link to the Met Museum page for that painting.
* The code lives on GitHub and the site is published on Vercel.


## How to work with me 

* Do ONE step at a time. Only build what I ask for in my current message. 
* Before writing code, briefly explain what you plan to do and wait for me to say "go".
* When the step is done, STOP. Tell me what you changed, then wait for my next instruction.
* Do not add placeholder code for features I have not asked for.
* Do not create or change files outside this project folder.
* If my request is unclear, ask one short question before starting.
* Ask before expanding the scope.


## Tech rules

* If you want to use a tool, library or framework, explain in simple words why it is needed in your plan, and wait for me to say "go".
* Never put API secret keys in the code. If a key is ever needed, let me know first.


## How to check your work

* After every change, tell me exactly what I should see on screen to confirm it works.
* Test your own work before telling me it is done.


## When something goes wrong

* Explain the problem in one or two simple sentences.
* Tell me your fix before you make it, and wait for my "go".
* Do not quietly rewrite large parts of the project to fix a small problem.


## Git and GitHub rules 

* Always work on your working branch. Never push to or switch to main. 
* Do not merge branches. I merge pull requests myself on GitHub. 
* Before every commit and push, say which branch you are on. If it is main, stop and ask me.
* Use short commit messages that describe what changed.


## Painting data 

* Use the Met Museum's free public API. 
* Only use paintings that are public domain and have an image. 
* Take the artist, year and link from the API. Never make them up. 
* If the API fails or returns no usable painting, tell me in simple words. 
* Do not invent a painting.


## Always true 

* The user can set the timer length (minutes and seconds). The default is 25 minutes. 
* Pause and Reset keep the same painting. Only "Restart session" loads a new one. 
* Painting details (artist, title, year, link) must never appear before the timer finishes. This includes hidden text, tooltips and image descriptions. 
* The timer must stay accurate when the browser tab is in the background. Calculate from the real end time instead of counting seconds.
